# labs2JSON
 Python code to translate laboratory information provided through Excel into harmonized EPOS infrastructure JSON.

 ## Version information

### Version 0.1
_*Conversion script only meant for single use*_

This inital version is meant to handle 4 different Excel-templates, i.e. one for each MSL subdomain.
The initial templates were partially inconsistently structured. If we proceed by using Excel-templates
we may move to a single highly structured template. The 'single-usage' code will then be translated
into OO-code ready for sustainable re-use.
