            "general_description": "The Earth’s Magnetic Field varies on significant timescale from its secular variation to polarity reversals and long-term changes in polarity reversal frequency to field intensities. The studies of the remanent magnetization of archeologic artefacts and rocks are the only means to survey how the magnetic field is generated in the earth’s core on long time scales (103 yr to 109 yr). \nBut the record of the earth’s magnetic field in rocks and archeologic material can also be used for different purposes. Magnetostratigraphy and archeomagnetic dating are important dating methods.\nPaleomagnetism was obviously the main contribution to the development of Plate Tectonics and is still an important method in tectonic studies.\nOur laboratory has a long history starting in the mid seventies with major contributions on tectonics, geomagnetic reversals, paleosecular variation and archeomagnetic dating. The archeomagnetic/paleomagnetic laboratory is hosted within a multi-disciplinary geosciences facility (UMR Géosciences Rennes – CNRS – Université de Rennes1). \n Our lab facility consists of four basic components:\n 1. Measurements of the remanent magnetizations: cryogenic magnetometer (2G helium free, hosted in a shielded room) and spinner magnetometers (Agico JR6A, JR5A and Molspin)\n2. Demagnetizing facilities: two MMTD furnaces for thermal demagnetization, a 2G AF degausser online with the cryogenic magnetometer, a GSD1 AF Schonstedt degausser.\n3. Imparting artificial remanent magnetizations: Homemade furnaces for thermoremanent magnetization acquisition in air or in vacuum (paleointensity studies), Isothermal Remanent Magnetization ASC pulse remagnetizers up to 4T; Anhysteretic Remanent Magnetization acquisition with the 2G AF degausser. One electromagnet up to 1T.\n4. Magnetic properties : study of the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility (KLY3S), and variation of the susceptibility with temperature.\nPlease find further informations here: https://geosciences.univ-rennes1.fr/mesure-de-laimantation\n",
