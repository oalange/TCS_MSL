        "general_description": "The Geomechanics Laboratory of CERENA/Instituto Superior Técnico (GEOLAB-CERENA/TECNICO) develops investigation in the field of Rock and Soil Mechanics applied to Mining, Petroleum and Geotechnical Engineering. \n\nThe GEOLAB-CERENA/TECNICO is a member of the European Plate Observing System EPOS and is broadly supplied with experimental equipment for the analysis of rock physics and geomechanics with the measurement of rock properties like strenght, elasticity, porosity, etc, and the modeling of subsurface sites and geological environments through a suite of customizable deformation devices.\n \nGEOLAB-CERENA/TECNICO has equipment that provides the execution of standard laboratorial and in situ tests and quantifying deformation in analogue models and high-resolution digital modeling through acoustic emissions, piezo and MEM acceleroments and meets the requests of mining and geotechnical companies developing frequently experimental surveys and technical reports. The development of innovative tests in this laboratory is also strongly encouraged for PhD and Master Students.\n \nFor further informations: http://cerena.ist.utl.pt/?page_id=5270",
