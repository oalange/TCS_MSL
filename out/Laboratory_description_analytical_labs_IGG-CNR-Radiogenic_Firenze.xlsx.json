        "general_description": "The Laboratory of Geochronology and Isotope Geochemistry of IGG-CNR (Italy) provides an integrated system of expertise, instrumental facilities and analytical protocols, suitable to accurately carry out: 1) geochronologic data by means of 40Arâ€“39Ar radiometric dating of potassic glasses and mineral, archaeomagentic dating of volcanic deposits and fiery structures, fission track analysis on apatite and zircon: 2) isotopic analysis of a wide variety of solid and aqueous matrices thanks to the availability of TIMS and MC-ICPMS techniques. The analytical skills of the IGG-CNR of Firenze are related to Fission Track Analysis.The laboratory includes: i) Zeiss Axioskop Microscope equipped with a Kinetek stage, light camera, digital tablet, PC+software for fission-track analysis; ii) stereomicroscope equipped with camera for apatite grain selection and single apatite grain packing for U-Th/He analysis. Access to: i) mineral separation laboratory for apatite and zircon concentration from rock samples and ii) thin section and special preparation laboratory for sample mountings and preparation of mica (external detector)-sample sandwich for irradiation.\n\nMethods and Expertise\nFission Track Analysis on apatite and zircon. Apatite grain selection for (U-Th-Sm)/He. Use of forward and inverse thermal modelling (HeFTy, QTQt, Pecube). The method can be applied to a wide range of rocks and dynamic environments for the reconstruction of rock thermal history in the more surficial levels of the crust, to landscape evolution and source to sink studies.\n",
