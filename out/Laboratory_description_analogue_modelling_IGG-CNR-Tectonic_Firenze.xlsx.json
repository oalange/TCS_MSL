        "general_description": "Types of analyses. The experimental technique involves the construction of analogue physical models at a reduced time and length scale of the natural geological process (prototype) under study. Although these models simplify the geometry and rheology, they represent a realistic dynamic and geometric replica of the prototype. The laboratory is equipped with a number of apparatuses (operating in both normal and enhanced gravity) that may simulate the different tangential and vertical forces acting in nature. Specifically, the apparatuses can induce deformation in both pure and simple shear conditions, allowing to investigate a large variety of crustal and lithospheric-scale experiments in extensional, compressional, or strike slip settings.\n\nLaboratory equipment:\n1) 1 large-capacity centrifuge PM980R (ALC International) that allows the deformation of physical models in an enhanced gravitational field, particularly suitable to model the continental extension processes.\n2) 1 pure-simple shear prototype apparatus that allows to vary the kinematics imposed to the mobile wall, thereby simulating the deformation in different tectonic settings. A special apparatus consists of an electrically-controlled piston that injects the silicone into the model to reproduce the emplacement of analogue magma during deformation. \n3) 1 pure shear prototype apparatus that allows the unidirectional deformation of the model.\n4) 1 coni-cylindrical viscometer for measuring the viscosity of experimental ductile materials. \n5) 1 apparatus for interferometric analysis of model surface. Sequential 3D digital elevation models (DEM) allow to analyse the evolution of tectonic structures and associated topographic response in great detail. \n6) 1 laser scanner Optix 400M (3D Digital Corporation) for monitoring (in all deformation apparatuses) the evolution of model topography through time. \n\nResearch activity. The activity of the ‘Tectonic Modelling Laboratory’ aims to investigate geological and tectonic processes occurring in nature at different scales, from mesoscopic to lithospheric. In particular, the main research lines address some of the tectonic processes that are fundamental for the evolution of Earth, particularly: continental extension, continental collision and development of orogenic belts, inversion tectonics, emplacement of magma in different geodynamic settings, and analysis of sedimentary basins. Other studies address geomorphological processes (e.g., modeling of ice flow and landslide phenomena) as well as the conservation of cultural heritage (e.g., stability analysis of the Michelangelo’s David). \n",
