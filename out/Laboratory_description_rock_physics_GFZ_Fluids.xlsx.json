        "general_description": "The research topics we address result from sustainable use of geothermal energy, carbon dioxide sequestration, and the use of natural methane hydrate deposits. In addition to characterizing a rock’s actual state investigations on dynamic processes and time-dependent physical changes are conducted. All experiments are performed under controlled pressure and temperature conditions that represent possible in situ conditions during reservoir use. Our experimental methodology is continuously developed further to conduct experiments at progressively more extreme, e.g. supercritical, conditions. Linking reservoir exploration and exploitation of geological reservoirs our scientific results contribute to their sustainable use. Our laboratories comprise state-of-the-art experimental devices for high pressure and high temperature rock mechanical, rock physical, and fluid physical investigations.",
