        "general_description": "The BCN-Stage at the Departament de Geologia, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Carreras et al., 2000) is a kinematically controlled device that operates under pure shear boundary conditions at variable room temperature (range of ≈20-35ºC). It is ideal for the modeling of ductile and ductile-brittle structures with analogue materials such as paraffin, plasticine, polymers or even other materials with melting point at room temperature such as chocolate, to simulate cooling of melts during progressive deformation (Druguet and Carreras, 2006). The apparatus is fully capable of reproducing the conditions that lead to deformation partitioning.  Several analogue materials can be combined in a single experiment in order to set complex initial configurations which may include layer and mechanical anisotropies, bodies of different shapes made up of rigid or molten materials, and material discontinuities (Druguet et al., 2015).\nIt is a prototype designed from a concept of J. Carreras and M. Julivert implemented by the company Enginyeria Teknics Sabadell, S.I. The sample is inserted in a rectangular deformation cell. While the vertical (Y) dimension of the cell remains constant at 10 cm, the lengths of the X and Z sides are variable, being driven by two electric motors which shorten/extend the deformation cell. In order to maintain confinement conditions and allow visualization during the experiment, the sample inside the deformation cell is covered by a thick glass panel. The deformation is operated by computer using the \"Makina Control\" software designed by AdCon sistemes S.L. Accessory devices connected directly to the BCN-Stage are a high resolution digital camera, two spotlights and a heater that is operated by a temperature control. \nThe mechanics and software of the BCN-Stage have been recently updated and a high-resolution digital camera has been adapted to the apparatus for photographic monitoring of experimental models. It is considered as one of the most sophisticated deformation devices in the world.\nThe BCN-Stage experiments focus on the assessment of the factors controlling localization and distribution of deformation in the Earth’s crust, preferably under ductile and ductile-brittle conditions. Folding and boudinage structures, fault and shear zones, and structures associated with the presence of rigid or soft inclusions are on the scope of our experiments. The controlling factors can be grouped into: rheological contrasts (e.g. lithological variations), mechanical anisotropies (e.g. foliation), structural discontinuities (e.g. fractures) and the interaction between different lithomechanical parameters. The impact of particularly complex pre-existing configurations on the distribution of the deformation can also be analysed. The main parameters to be evaluated are the medium (homogeneous / heterogeneous, isotropic / anisotropic) and, in the case of heterogeneous and anisotropic media, the orientation of the anisotropy (bands, foliation, fractures) with respect to the kinematic axes.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                    Please find further informations http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/miet/content/laboratory\n\n",
