            "general_description": "The residual magnetism of archaeological remains of burned clay is a major source of information for the state of the Earth`s magnetic field in the past. The recovery of the three main geomagnetic field`s elements (defining its direction and intensity) recorded in well dated archaeological materials, leads to the accumulation of an unique local database that cannot be obtained by other methods. The Bulgarian archaeomagnetic database can be considered as the longest local dataset in the world, covering almost fully the last 8000 years going back to Neolithic (Kovacheva et al. 2014, PEPI, 236, 79-94). The Bulgarian reference curves are calculated based on over 300 reference points, which are included in the GEOMAGIA50.v3 global database (http://geomagia.ucsd.edu). Among the other archaeomagnetic laboratories, the Sofia laboratory was the first to be engaged in the simultaneous determination of the full geomagnetic field vector (D, I, F) from one and the same material. Dedicated efforts of the team members of Sofia Palaeomagnetic Lab aim further continuation and refinement of the experimental methods for reliable determination of the geomagnetic field elements and palaeosecular variation curves. \nAnother major thematic priority in the research activity of the team members is obtaining reliable global and regional records of the past climatic changes during the glacial Pleistocene through studies of loess-paleosoil sequences. Detailed magneto-mineralogical and magnetostratigraphic studies on a number of loess-paleosol profiles from North Bulgaria have been carried out during the last 15 years, which reveal the high sensitivity of the magnetic signature to climate change. Further development of the environmental direction of the research topic has been achieved by introduction of the magnetometric method for study of the degree of anthropogenic pollution of soils, sediments, and dust from urban areas. All of the above mentioned research directions utilize the basic magnetic instrumentation available in the Laboratory. It can be classified in three different classes:\n- Laboratory equipment for mineral magnetic characterization of natural materials\n- Laboratory equipment for archaeomagnetic and palaeomagnetic studies\n- Auxiliary lab instrumentation for physical characterization of the materials â€“ magnetic separation, milling, wet and dry sieving, soil pH determination, etc.\n\nMore information on the major results and activities of the Paleomagnetic Lab at NIGGG can be found at: www.niggg.bas.bg \n\n",
