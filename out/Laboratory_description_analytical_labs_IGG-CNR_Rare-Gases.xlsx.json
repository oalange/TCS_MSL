        "general_description": "The five stable noble gases or “rare gases”, Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, and Xenon, are chemically inert, making them good tracers for physical processes. Due to their elevated volatility, they have a strong affinity for the gas phase. Noble gases provide a group of 23 stable isotopes widely used to investigate physical processes in nature (earth and extra-terrestrial systems ). Three major terrestrial reservoirs contribute to noble gas inventory in terrestrial fluids (water, gas, oil): (i) Atmosphere and Air Saturated Water (ASW); (ii) Solid-Earth-derived fluids, related to the radiogenic or nucleogenic production, from parent radionuclide dispersed in the rock matrix and/or in embedded fluids; (iii) Mantle fluids have a significantly different signature from the other reservoirs mainly for high 3He enrichment in fluids. All these reservoirs have a quite distinct chemical and isotopic signature that allows for efficient tracing of the different relative contribution in geological matrices. Noble gases have found large application as tracers in: hydrogeology, geothermal prospection/exploitation, volcanology, gas/oil reservoirs management, viability assessment of CO2 geological storage, further to as indicators of: climate variations in ice cores, pore sediments and fluid inclusions in stalagmites, and degassing/mixing processes during the formation of the Solar system and of the Earth.    The research and services at the Rare Gas Lab are based on the use of noble gases to determine the origin of fluids from different tectonic environments. The Rare Gas lab contains a mass spectrometer system, capable of precise isotopic measurements of the noble gases, made up of: (i) a Mass Analyser Products Ltd. MAP215-50 noble gas mass spectrometer; (ii) a SpectraLab200 Quadrupole mass spectrometer; (iii) a UHV gas inlet system equipped with a cryostat and designed to be versatile and to extract noble gases from a variety of materials.
