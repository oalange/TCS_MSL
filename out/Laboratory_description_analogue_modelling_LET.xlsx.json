The LET was born on 1994, following the international tradition on experimental modelling and it has been the first Italian analog laboratory.  \nThe scientific activity of the LET is focused on four main research themes:\n\n1. crustal deformations (orogenetic and rifting processes);\n2. lithospheric deformations (subduction, delamination, post-glacial rebound);\n3. magmatic processes (volcano-tectonics and intrusive processes)\n4. rupture and propagation of faults in the crust/lithosphere.\n\nThe LET merges methodologic research lines having geodynamic goals and direct applications to natural hazards. \nThe study of crustal scale deformations provided insights into the deformation variability of natural systems as a function of the brittle-ductile strength of the crust. Innovative models have been setup building up a thermomechanical prototype.\nLithospheric scale deformations have been studied characterizing the geometry/kinematics/dynamics of the subduction process during the journey of the slab into the upper and lower mantle. A parametric analysis has been dedicated to highlight the role played by dimension/density/viscosity of lithosphere and mantle in the subduction process. The LET activity has been distinguished for its studies on the subduction induced mantle circulation and the dynamic topography associated to this process.\nMagmatic processes have been studied looking at deformations induced by both magma injection in volcanoes or plutons and the collapse of volcanic edifices.\nThe availability of a rheometer allows for the selection and the rheological characterization of analog materials. In particular, the  “pig skin” gelatin has been used to set-up novel analog models to shed light on the behavior of the subduction thrust fault and to provide insights on the triggering of mega-earthquakes.\n\nThe recent logistic and structural improvements of the LET and the development of quantification techniques consolidated the already wide number of national and international collaborations, increasing their quality and quantity. The LET is thus a reference analog laboratory in the scientific community. This is also mirrored by the involvement of the LET in numerous scientific projects (e.g., PRIN-MIUR, National Civil Protection, EC, NSF, ESF, EUROHORC) and outreach activities (e.g., Committee on Education EGU, Geo&Geo, Discovery’s Science Channel). Moreover, the LET researchers have been awarded with several prizes (e.g., EURYI award 2006, Premio Galileo 2010, EGU Stephan Muller medal 2014, Burgen Scholar Award 2009, EGU Outstanding Early Career Scientists Award 2018, Burov medal 2018, AGU medal 2018) for the high level of their scientific results \n\n",
