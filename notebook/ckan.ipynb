The facility also has the\\r\\nrequired material (glass and PTFE) for chemical preparation and the use\\r\\nof various chemical solutions such as hydrochloric (HCl) and\\r\\nhydrofluoric (HF) acids, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)\\r\\nand heavy density liquids (SPT). The paleomagnetism laboratory, as an\\r\\nintegral part of the Geochronology facility, was set up in 2009, with\\r\\nthe aim of pursuing research in the field of Quaternary geology and\\r\\npaleontology, as well as providing support to research groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nRocks, sediments, and soil, contain traces of ferromagnetic minerals,\\r\\nwhich magnetization is aligned with the Earth's magnetic field, and\\r\\ntherefore act as fossil compasses that record the Earth\\u2019s magnetic field\\r\\nof the past. The most common ferromagnetic minerals include magnetite\\r\\n(Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>),\\r\\ngoethite (\\u03b1-FeOOH) and some iron sulfides (e.g., greigite,\\r\\nFe<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>).

The ability of MSCL systems to acquire a wealth of\\r\\ninformation on the physical properties of geological cores means that\\r\\nalmost anyone who is interested in the analysis of geological materials\\r\\nwould benefit from the use of an MSCL.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe benefits to both the scientific community and industry have been\\r\\ndocumented several times over the years for example by Rothwell (2006)\\r\\nand Vatandoost et al.

The set-up is\\r\\nequipped with a pore fluid pressure control system plus sample\\r\\ndilatometry and permeametry systems (gas, transient step and\\r\\nliquid-steady state flow-through capabilities). Confining and pore fluid\\r\\npressure are controlled using ISCO 65D servo-controlled pumps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Heard triaxial apparatus is suited for axisymmetric compression\\r\\ntesting of cylindrical samples at confining pressures up to 100 MPa, and\\r\\ntemperatures up to 400 \\u00b0C, either at constant stress (creep tests) or\\r\\nconstant strain rate (10<sup>-4</sup>-10<sup>-7</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>).\\r\\nIn addition, it is possible to perform stress stepping and relaxation\\r\\ntests, as well as strain rate stepping tests. This machine has been used\\r\\nto study subsurface CO2 mineralisation and fault rock permeability. The\\r\\nHeard apparatus can be used for direct shear friction experiments as\\r\\nwell, making use of a two-component direct shear assembly. The direct\\r\\nshear assembly consists of two L-shaped forcing pistons, sandwiching a\\r\\ngouge layer of dimensions 47x35 mm and 1-2.5 mm thickness in between.\\r\\nBoth constant strain rate and strain rate stepping tests can be carried\\r\\nout in the direct shear configuration (same conditions as for\\r\\naxisymmetric compression testing), with the purpose of measuring the\\r\\nfrictional resistance and the time- and velocity-dependence of friction.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Triaxial compression apparatus with pore fluid pressure control, pore volumometry and direct shear option (Shuttle vessel)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis internally heated, 100 MPa confining pressure vessel is mounted on\\r\\na standard Instron 1362 loading frame with a servo-controlled\\r\\npositioning system. This machine can be used to deform cylindrical\\r\\nsamples at a constant piston velocity, ranging from 10<sup>-7</sup> to\\r\\n10<sup>-2</sup> m/s. The displacement is measured outside the vessel\\r\\nusing a (Instron standard) linear variable differential transformer\\r\\n(LVDT), with 2 \\u03bcm resolution. The apparatus is equipped with two\\r\\n(internally and externally located) load cells, each of 100 kN capacity.\\r\\nThe confinement on jacketed samples is done by silicone oil, with the\\r\\npressure being controlled by a servo pump, which also serves as\\r\\ndilatometer to carefully monitor the compaction/dilation of the sample\\r\\nunder study. It is also facilitated with an internal heating furnace to\\r\\nlocally heat up the sample, up to a maximum temperature of 150 \\u00b0C.\\r\\nRecently, a high-resolution stress-relaxation method was developed for\\r\\nsimulating rheology at in-situ conditions (strain rates down to\\r\\n10<sup>-9</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). Like the **<span\\r\\nclass=\\\"underline\\\">Heard apparatus</span>**, the Shuttle vessel can also\\r\\nbe used for direct shear friction experiments, by installing a sample\\r\\nassembly consisting of two L-shaped forcing pistons, sandwiching a gouge\\r\\nlayer of dimensions 47x35 mm and 1-2.5 mm thickness in between.\\r\\n\\r\\n### High precision triaxial compression apparatus with pore fluid plus full axial and radial servo control (NAM Machine)\\r\\n\\r\\nExternally heated, 120 MPa oil pressure medium, servo controlled\\r\\ntriaxial deformation apparatus with 200kN axial load capability. Using\\r\\nan internal axial force gauge with low pressure sensitivity, this\\r\\nmachine features programmable pore fluid and confining fluid pressure\\r\\nfeedback control of ISCO 65D syringe pumps to allow high precision,\\r\\nconstant radial strain deformation, to failure, of jacketed 50 mm long\\r\\ncylindrical x 25 mm diameter, rock samples at temperatures up to 150 \\u00b0C.\\r\\nUnique design with drive mechanics within the pressure vessel to\\r\\neliminate control hysteresis from seal friction.\\u00a0 Controlled loading is\\r\\npossible via a programmable motor drive subsystem with an automatic gear\\r\\nchanger. The overall control system developed by UU using LabView links\\r\\nall features of deformation apparatus. The machine and system\\r\\ndevelopment is funded by NAM.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Gas medium, high precision servo-controlled triaxial testing machine (gas apparatus, 600 MPa, 1200 \\u00b0C) \\r\\n\\r\\nThis internally heated machine can generate pressures of up to 600 MPa\\r\\nand temperatures of up to 1200 \\u00b0C. Additional differential loading may\\r\\nbe applied via an Instron loading frame, to deform materials under lower\\r\\ncrustal to upper mantle conditions. Typical applications involve studies\\r\\nof rock rheology and deformation mechanisms at high pressure and\\r\\ntemperatures. Recently, the gas apparatus has been used to constrain the\\r\\nstrain-dependent rheological behaviour of the lithosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nRotary shear deformation/friction facilities\\r\\n--------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n### High PT hydrothermal rotary shear apparatus \\r\\n\\r\\nThis machine is located in an Instron 1362 testing machine for normal\\r\\nstress control. The ring shear machine can be used for shear experiments\\r\\nwith a temperature up to about 700 \\u00b0C, normal stresses up to 300 MPa,\\r\\nshear velocities in the range from 3 nm/s up to 0.3 mm/s, a pore fluid\\r\\npressure up to 200 MPa and ultrahigh shear strains beyond 100.\\r\\nCurrently, this machine is used for the research projects described\\r\\nunder fault mechanics.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Room T low-medium velocity rotary shear apparatus with AE capabilities\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apparatus is housed inside a 100 kN capacity Instron 8862 testing\\r\\nmachine equipped with a servo-controlled electromechanical actuator that\\r\\nmay be operated either in position control or in load control mode. A\\r\\nParker MH205 motor provides rotary motion to the base plate via a 1:160\\r\\nharmonic drive gearbox, allowing a maximum rotation rate of 12.5 rpm.\\r\\nUsing the motor\\u2019s onboard servo-controller, it is possible to control\\r\\neither the rotation rate (and thus shear displacement) or the torque\\r\\n(and thus the shear stress). The base plate is equipped with two angular\\r\\npotentiometers that measure its rotation and is capable of housing\\r\\nsamples or pistons of up to 100 mm in diameter. The exact possible range\\r\\nof normal stress and sliding velocities depends on the sample size but\\r\\nare in general between 0.5-40 MPa and 0.01 to 50 mm/s. Some piston sets\\r\\nallow the use of a pressurized pore fluid. A dedicated piston set is\\r\\nequipped with 8 holes on both sides that house AE sensors which are\\r\\ncapable of registering acoustic emissions generated during laboratory\\r\\nearthquakes (\\u201cstick-slips\\u201d). The apparatus has no heating capabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nUniaxial compaction (oedometer) and sorption/dilatometry facilities\\r\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n### Uniaxial (oedometer) compaction cell with pore fluid pressure control (Monel vessel)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cell is located in an Instron 8862 loading frame. The compaction\\r\\ncell is equipped with an internal load cell (max. axial load 100 kN) and\\r\\nan acoustic emission sensor. Fluids can be introduced into the sample\\r\\nusing an ISCO 65D syringe pump (vessel can accommodate fluid pressures\\r\\nof up to 137.9 MPa). Temperature (range up to 100 \\u00b0C, if the internal\\r\\nload cell is used) is controlled using an external furnace. This cell is\\r\\nprimarily used to investigate the effect of fluid chemistry on the\\r\\ncompaction of various earth materials, including coals, shales, various\\r\\nevaporite minerals, sands and sandstones.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Uniaxial (oedometer) compaction cell with flow-through capabilities (Remanit vessel)\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Instron 8562 servo-controlled loading frame, furnished with a 100 kN\\r\\nload cell, is coupled with a Remanit compaction vessel in which the\\r\\ntemperature (up to 150 \\u00b0C) and fluid pressure (up to 20 MPa) are\\r\\nprecisely controlled. This oedometer-type testing system is further\\r\\nequipped with ISCO 65D syringe pumps and instrumentation to facilitate\\r\\nconcurrent mechanical testing and reactive flow-through permeametry. The\\r\\nsetup is mainly used to investigate the mechanical response of earth\\r\\nmaterials undergoing any physical-chemical reactions with reservoir\\r\\nfluids under in-situ hydro-thermo-mechanical conditions. Examples\\r\\ninclude measuring the swelling stress developed in shale and coal due to\\r\\nCO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> adsorption, which is of great importance\\r\\nfor CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and enhanced shale gas and coal bed\\r\\nmethane recovery, and studying potential force of crystallization\\r\\ndevelopment in mineral reactions such as metal oxide hydration and\\r\\nperidotite carbonation.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 100 MPa sorption dilatometer (eddy current dilatometer)\\r\\n\\r\\nTo measure dimensional changes of mm-sized, cylindrical samples, we have\\r\\na purpose-built dilatometer consisting of a high-pressure, eddy current\\r\\nsensor, housed in a Remanit stainless steel pressure vessel (inner\\r\\ndiameter of 20 mm). Fluid pressures of up to 100 MPa can be introduced\\r\\nto the sample. The assembly allows for measurement of axial expansion or\\r\\ncontraction of the sample upon exposure to fluid. The entire set-up can\\r\\nbe submerged in a thermobath, to achieve a constant experimental\\r\\ntemperature.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 3D Dilatometer\\r\\n\\r\\nThis setup consists of three high resolution (~25 nm) eddy current\\r\\nsensors, which are assembled in orthogonal directions, sealed in a glass\\r\\nchamber. With this setup one can measure sorption/desorption induced\\r\\nswelling/shrinkage of tiny cubic samples (&lt;15 mm) exposed to\\r\\nlow-pressure gas (e.g. water vapour) environments.\\r\\n\\r\\nPermeametry and conductivity apparatus\\r\\n--------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n### Transient step gas permeameter\\r\\n\\r\\nPermeabilities of cores (diameters of 25mm and 35 mm) and powders can be\\r\\nmeasured in the lab using the pressure transient pulse decay method.\\r\\nThis apparatus is suitable for number of different gasses (Argon,\\r\\nHelium, CO<sub>2</sub> and methane) and can be used over a wide range of\\r\\nconfining pressures. The transient step gas permeameter can also be used\\r\\nin conjunction with the **<span class=\\\"underline\\\">Heard\\r\\napparatus</span>**, to measure the permeability of samples deformed by\\r\\ntriaxial compressive loading.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Contact resistivity cell (Solartron 1206A, Solartron 1296A dielectric interface)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cell can be used at (approximately) room temperature and under\\r\\natmospheric pressure conditions to measure the electric resistivity of a\\r\\npressure dissolving, annular contact between a glass lens and a salt\\r\\ncrystal. At the same time, the growing contact can be directly observed\\r\\nthrough the glass lens. This cell has been used for example in the\\r\\ninvestigation of the structural and diffusional properties of grain\\r\\nboundaries under stress.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Pressurised conductivity cell\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cell is submerged in an oil bath and the temperature may be\\r\\ncontrolled to approximately 0.1 \\u00b0C. Impedance spectroscopy with this\\r\\ncell can be done by use of a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer\\r\\nand 1296 dielectric interface. This cell is used for impedance\\r\\nspectroscopy on loaded powders with pore fluid and has recently been\\r\\nused on coal samples.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuxiliary facilities\\r\\n--------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n-   Vertical Tube furnace with controlled atmosphere\\r\\n\\r\\n-   Nabertherm Superkanthal 1600 \\u00b0C furnace\\r\\n\\r\\n-   Impedance Spectroscopy Solartron 1260\\r\\n\\r\\n-   Lab presses suitable for pressing material under loads up to 400 kN\\r\\n\\r\\n-   Du Pont 1090 DTA/TGA Thermal Analyser\\r\\n\\r\\n-   Malvern Instruments Mastersizer S long bed laser diffraction\\r\\n    particle size analyser\\r\\n\\r\\n-   JASCO 620 infrared/optical microscope with FTIR microanalysis system\\r\\n\\r\\n-   Leica DMRX light optical polarization microscope with image analysis\\r\\n    QWIN Pro\\r\\n\"\n",

GeoRessources\\r\\nemploys a total of 180 personnel and orientates itself around three main\\r\\nresearch themes:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGeoModels\\u201d is a meeting-place for specialists in geometrical,\\r\\ngeostatistical and physical-process modelling. The objectives are to\\r\\nforge strong collaborations between experts in digital and experimental\\r\\nsimulation and to unite geometrical, inverse, hydrogeochemical and\\r\\nmechanical approaches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cRaw Materials\\u201d is a place for interaction and exchange between experts\\r\\nin the exploration, exploitation and treatment of carbon and mineral\\r\\nresources. Geologists, geochemists, metallogenists and mineralogists can\\r\\ninteract freely with one another. The \\u2018Raw Materials\\u2019 mission is to\\r\\ndevelop models that explore upstream and downstream resource cycles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGeoSystems\\u201d is a synergistic space that hosts experts in underground\\r\\nexploitation for the storage of waste and geothermal energy, as well as\\r\\nspecialists in the hazards and risks associated with anthropogenic\\r\\nactivity such as mining and excavation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the field of resource exploitation is developing like never\\r\\nbefore, it is essential that specialists from across the different\\r\\nresearch themes work together in finding new ways to minimize the\\r\\nenvironmental impact of resource exploitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Geomodels and Geosystems themes conduct interdisciplinary research\\r\\nconcerned with the use and management of the surface and sub-surface\\r\\nenvironment, with a strong focus on the safety of underground\\r\\nstructures. Applications address local and national socio-economic\\r\\nissues, including geotechnics, environmental protection, and the surface\\r\\nand sub-surface storage of waste, CO2 and H2. The originality of the\\r\\nteam\\u2019s work lies in addressing these issues from the points of view of\\r\\nhydrodynamics and transfer mechanisms, as well as from poro-mechanics\\r\\nand geochemical perspectives.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific goals of the Raw Materials theme concern a better\\r\\nunderstanding of: i) metals concentrations associated with crustal\\r\\ngrowth and evolution within the frame of plate tectonics (multimethod\\r\\napproach combining field geology, structural analysis, petrology,\\r\\ngeochemistry, geochronology), ii) the processes governing the extraction\\r\\nof metals from rock sources, their transport by fluid phases\\r\\n(speciation, especially through experimental studies, and spectroscopic\\r\\nmonitoring, fluid origin), and iii) ore formation (PVTX reconstruction\\r\\nthrough integrated paleo-fluid studies (microthermometry, Raman,\\r\\nspectroscopy, LA-ICP-MS), thermodynamic and experimental modeling dating\\r\\nof ore stages), the overall data yielding to conceptual and numerical\\r\\nmodelling of the genesis of ore deposits within their geologic and\\r\\ngeodynamic contexts.\\r\\n\"\n",

The HPHT Lab\\r\\nincludes three areas of investigation: 1) experimental testing of\\r\\nnatural and synthetic materials; 2) microanalytical and physical\\r\\nanalyses; 3) analog experiments. Volcanology, petrology, mineralogy,\\r\\nseismology, and rock physics are the main, broad areas of research at\\r\\nthe HPHT Lab.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning the experimental investigations, research in magma evolution\\r\\nand rheology, and on mantle petrology are carried out with high-pressure\\r\\nand high-temperature apparatuses, including furnaces, piston-cylinder,\\r\\nand multi-anvil devices, covering conditions from surface eruption of\\r\\nmagma to middle mantle. The frictional properties of faults and rocks\\r\\nare investigated under a wide range of slip rates and dynamics and under\\r\\nvariable boundary conditions using unique rotary shear apparatus and\\r\\nlarge-scale bi-axial press. In addition, rock physics/mechanics studies,\\r\\nfrom rock permeability to fracturing and degassing can also be\\r\\ninvestigated with the above apparatuses and with more classical devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe analytical facilities include a Field-Emission Scanning Electron\\r\\nMicroscope and an Electron Micro Probe Analyzer specifically tuned for\\r\\nnatural rock analyses. Accessory to these are an helium pycnometer,\\r\\nparticle size analyzer, sieves, and other basic instruments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe analog investigations are carried out in a specific area where\\r\\nad-hoc, temporary set-ups are developed. Analog materials are\\r\\ncharacterized using a rheometer, and the experiments are recorded and\\r\\nanalyzed using a range of visual documentations, spanning from\\r\\ntime-lapse cameras to high-definition and high-speed camcorders. The\\r\\nanalog laboratory focuses mostly on explosive volcanism and the related\\r\\nproducts and processes, including the formation and release of Taylor\\r\\nbubbles, pyroclast ejection during supersonic eruptions, and the\\r\\nsedimentation and aggregation of volcanic ash particles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe HPHT Lab also hosts and develops new systems for the in-situ study\\r\\nof explosive volcanic eruptions by combining high-speed, high-definition\\r\\nimaging in the visible and thermal infrared wavelengths with acoustic\\r\\nrecording. Investigated processes cover the ejection of volcanic ash and\\r\\nbombs, their settling and potential hazard, the sources of volcanic\\r\\nsound, and shifting styles of explosive volcanic activity. The sharing\\r\\nof facilities and working space in between researchers with such a broad\\r\\nvariety of backgrounds is a key component of the HPHT Lab, eventually\\r\\nleading to interdisciplinary exchange, facilitating the development of\\r\\nnew projects, and ultimately promoting a stimulating research\\r\\nenvironment.\\r\\n\"\n",

In contrast to artificial samples, natural ones consist\\r\\nalmost always of several magnetic mineral species, evidence multimodal\\r\\ngrain size distributions, different shapes and compositions. Measured\\r\\nbulk magnetic properties represent therefore a mixture of individual\\r\\nmagnetic components, which one aims to decipher and to quantify. Proper\\r\\ninterpretation is therefore only possible by applying a broad spectrum\\r\\nof experimental techniques requiring an appropriate technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe follow this multi-experimental approach on the one hand to\\r\\ncharacterize carriers of natural remanent magnetization. This concerns\\r\\nfor instance reliability assessment of palaeointensity determinations\\r\\nand palaeomagnetic directions, necessary for our research in\\r\\nmagnetostratigraphy, archaeomagnetism and reconstruction of\\r\\npalaeosecular variation. On the other hand, we exploit this approach for\\r\\ncharacterization and interpretation of Quaternary sedimentary sequences,\\r\\nDevonian marine carbonate platforms and archaeological as well as\\r\\npolluted environments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt national level we are tightly linked with the archaeological\\r\\ncommunity and the Belgian research landscape. At international level we\\r\\nare networked with communities dedicated to research in magnetic\\r\\nnanoparticles, standardization of magnetic properties, archaeometry and\\r\\npalaeomagnetism. We are part of national and European networks such as\\r\\nfor instance national cooperation conventions in archaeology, COST\\r\\nActions TD1402, CA17131 and the European Plate Observing System (EPOS).\\r\\nIn 2016, we hosted the 15th Castle Meeting \\u201cNew Trends on Paleo, Rock\\r\\nand Environmental Magnetism\\u201d in Dinant and organized a pre-meeting short\\r\\ncourse for students on rock magnetism.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur laboratory facility consists of three units:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.  The sample preparation unit is equipped with necessary devices for\\r\\n    preparation of archaeological geological, soil samples and\\r\\n    ferrofluid suspensions including treatments such as chemical\\r\\n    extractions, hardening, magnetic separation and removal of organic\\r\\n    matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.  The remanence unit features necessary devices for acquisition,\\r\\n    demagnetisation and measurement of the most common types of remanent\\r\\n    magnetization such as anhysteretic, crystallization, isothermal,\\r\\n    natural, post-depositional and thermo- and viscous remanence. These\\r\\n    devices are used for archaeomagnetic dating, magnetostratigraphy and\\r\\n    analysis of remanence carriers.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.  The characterization unit is endowed with typical instruments for\\r\\n    field and laboratory measurements of magnetic properties, as well as\\r\\n    with devices for non-magnetic characterization such as grain\\r\\n    density, pH and porosity. In addition, a highly sophisticated\\r\\n    measurement system enables magnetic characterization of samples over\\r\\n    a wide range of fields and temperatures and at several AC-field\\r\\n    frequencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease find further information here:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://dourbes.meteo.be/en/research/environmentalmagnetism\\r\\n\"\n",

The LET was born on\\r\\n1994, following the international tradition on experimental modelling\\r\\nand it has been the first Italian analog laboratory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientific activity of the LET is focused on four main research\\r\\nthemes:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. crustal deformations (orogenetic and rifting processes);\\r\\n\\r\\n2. lithospheric deformations (subduction, delamination, post-glacial\\r\\nrebound);\\r\\n\\r\\n3. magmatic processes (volcano-tectonics and intrusive processes)\\r\\n\\r\\n4. rupture and propagation of faults in the crust/lithosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe LET merges methodologic research lines having geodynamic goals and\\r\\ndirect applications to natural hazards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe study of crustal scale deformations provided insights into the\\r\\ndeformation variability of natural systems as a function of the\\r\\nbrittle-ductile strength of the crust. Innovative models have been setup\\r\\nbuilding up a thermomechanical prototype.\\r\\n\\r\\nLithospheric scale deformations have been studied characterizing the\\r\\ngeometry/kinematics/dynamics of the subduction process during the\\r\\njourney of the slab into the upper and lower mantle. A parametric\\r\\nanalysis has been dedicated to highlight the role played by\\r\\ndimension/density/viscosity of lithosphere and mantle in the subduction\\r\\nprocess. The LET activity has been distinguished for its studies on the\\r\\nsubduction induced mantle circulation and the dynamic topography\\r\\nassociated to this process.\\r\\n\\r\\nMagmatic processes have been studied looking at deformations induced by\\r\\nboth magma injection in volcanoes or plutons and the collapse of\\r\\nvolcanic edifices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe availability of a rheometer allows for the selection and the\\r\\nrheological characterization of analog materials. In particular, the\\r\\n\\u201cpig skin\\u201d gelatin has been used to set-up novel analog models to shed\\r\\nlight on the behavior of the subduction thrust fault and to provide\\r\\ninsights on the triggering of mega-earthquakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recent logistic and structural improvements of the LET and the\\r\\ndevelopment of quantification techniques consolidated the already wide\\r\\nnumber of national and international collaborations, increasing their\\r\\nquality and quantity. The LET is thus a reference analog laboratory in\\r\\nthe scientific community. This is also mirrored by the involvement of\\r\\nthe LET in numerous scientific projects (e.g., PRIN-MIUR, National Civil\\r\\nProtection, EC, NSF, ESF, EUROHORC) and outreach activities (e.g.,\\r\\nCommittee on Education EGU, Geo&Geo, Discovery\\u2019s Science Channel).\\r\\nMoreover, the LET researchers have been awarded with several prizes\\r\\n(e.g., EURYI award 2006, Premio Galileo 2010, EGU Stephan Muller medal\\r\\n2014, Burgen Scholar Award 2009, EGU Outstanding Early Career Scientists\\r\\nAward 2018, Burov medal 2018, AGU medal 2018) for the high level of\\r\\ntheir scientific results\\r\\n\"\n",

      "    \"description\": \"**Micro-CT laboratory (INGV, Italy)**\\r\\n\\r\\nX-ray computed tomography (micro-ct) is a powerful technique for qualitative and quantitative studies of rocks and other materials in three dimensions. One of the key advantages of X-ray tomography is that it is relatively non destructive, which allows for objects to be studied in situ. Particularly, micro-ct reveals the internal microstructure of the rocks (e.g. 3D orientation and distribution of cracks, pores, grains, minerals, sedimentary patterns, fossils, fluid inclusions etc.) throughout the construction of three-dimensional digital maps with very high resolution that can reach up to the submicron. In the last decade this technique has become an essential part in geoscience studies (e.g. igneous and metamorphic petrology, planetary geology, ore deposit, hydrology, sedimentology, petroleum, structural geology, environmental geology etc).\\r\\n\\r\\nOur INGV laboratory is involved in the study of natural phenomena in volcanic and seismic risk contexts (mechanisms of vesiculation, crystallization and magmatic fragmentation, fracture propagation, circulation of fluids, alteration processes, etc).\\r\\n\\r\\nOur laboratory includes a micro-ct system (Zeiss Xradia 410 Versa) equipped with a microfocus Xray source capable of energies from 40 to 150 kV, which allows the scanning of samples with a wide range of densities. The detectors are mounted on microscope objectives with magnifications ranging from 0.4X to 20X; the former yields a field of view of ~55 mm, whereas the latter yields ~1 mm. Thus the spatial resolution for the microXCT ranges from ~55 \\u00b5m to 0.9 \\u00b5m. The microXCT scanner also offers the advantage of enhanced phase contrast to better image materials with low mean atomic numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur laboratory includes dedicated software for the visualization and quantitative analysis of three-dimensional digital maps and for pore-scale numerical simulations for fluid transport properties prediction (e.g. absolute and relative permeabilities).\"\n",

The research activities resulted in a wide scientific literature, which brought to the INGV paleomagnetic laboratory a remarkable scientific reputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1993, the core of the infrastructure is a shielded room, which reduces the intensity of the magnetic field inside to a few thousandths of the local geomagnetic field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room houses two cryogenic magnetometers and the Pyrox and ASC Scientific thermal demagnetizers, for heating the samples up to 700\\u00b0C; all the instruments inside the room also have additional \\u03bc-metal shields for further insulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paleomagnetic laboratory also benefits from a adjoining room and a cold room for the storage of cores and u-channel samples.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking forward for cooperatioons under the EPOS framework, we report here a list of the main available scientific instruments!\\r\\n\\r\\n## 2G Cryogenic Magnetometers \\r\\n\\r\\nThe DC SQUID magnetometers are based on superconducting loops containing Josephson junctions at liquid helium temperature (4K). They can measure both standard discrete (cylinders of rock to 2.5 cm in diameter 2.2 cm high) and continuous paleomagnetic samples (u-channels of up to 1.5 m in length and a square section of 1.9 cm side). The magnetometers are equipped with computer controlled in-line devices, including three orthogonal coils for alternating magnetic field (AF) degaussing of the samples, with the possibility of imparting anhysteretic remanent magnetization.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe older magnetometer was installed in 1996, and keeps the low temperature with a 60 l reservoir of liquid helium, enough for about 1.5 years of operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquid-helium-free 2G Cryogenic Magnetometer was installed in 2006 and works without the periodical liquid helium fillings.\\r\\n\\r\\n## AGICO JR6 Spinner Magnetometers\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these Faraday-Neumann law-operating magnetometers, the sample rotates up to 90 cycles/s inside a pair of coils, inducing a electromotive force proportional to the magnetization of the sample. These magnetometers are very reliable but less sensitive than cryogenic magnetometers, but they are recommended for highly magnetized samples, which saturate the cryo system.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Princeton Micromag 2900/3900 AGM/VSM Magnetometer\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh precision and sensitivity instrument for measuring hysteresis loops, FORCs and other magnetic properties; the sensitivity is 10 nemu as alternating gradient magnetometer and 0.5 \\u03bcemu as vibrating sample magnetometer.

The MFK1 is coupled to a CS3 furnace, for analyzing the variation of the magnetic susceptibility during a cycle from room temperature up to 700 \\u00b0C and back. Moreover, the CS-L apparatus allows the measurement of the variation of magnetic susceptibility in low-temperature cycles up to liquid nitrogen temperature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe laboratory is equipped with other facilities and instruments, such as the AGICO LDA-3A AF demagnetizer, in connection to the AMU-1A anhysteretic magnetizer, or a 2G pulse magnetizer, for applying magnetic fields up to 2.7 T\\r\\n\\r\\nFor any further info, please visit the [link](http://roma2.rm.ingv.it/en/units/3/paleomagnetism_laboratory).\\r\\n\"\n",

      "    \"description\": \"***\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tectonic modelling laboratory (TecLab) is the main research facility of the _Tectonics research group_ (https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences/tectonics), and a key infrastructure in the Earth Simulation Laboratory (ESL) of the _Department of Earth Sciences at Utrecht University (UU)_ (https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences). Research conducted in the TecLab aims to improve our fundamental understanding of the multi-scale (spatial and temporal) parameters and rock behaviour that control the mutual interaction of deep Earth and surface processes. To pursue this key objective, research performed in the TecLab is typically integrated with and strongly tied to field and numerical modelling studies, enabling to develop novel approaches and methodologies.\\r\\nThis unique integrated modelling approach has established the TecLab as a renowned tectonic modelling laboratory, also evidenced by the long term involvement of the TecLab in a wide range of national and international research projects and programs (e.g. ESF TOPO-EUROPE; EU-Topomod; EU-Subitop; EU-GEMEX). Moreover, the TecLab is linked also to the Dutch Research Centre for Integrated Solid Earth Sciences, as well as to the European Plate Observatory System (EPOS). And at UU the TecLab facility plays a key role in undergraduate and graduate education as well as in outreach activities. \\r\\nIn the TecLab, we use \\\"scaled physical analogue models\\\" to better understand (large scale) deformation processes that occur in the Earth\\u2019s lithosphere in response to plate motions or intra-plate deformation; examples include the breakup of the Earth's crust and the formation of sedimentary basins, the formation of mountain ranges or the development of subduction zones. The spatial scale of applications typically stretches from reservoir and basin (hundreds of meters to kilometre) to plate (hundreds of kilometres) scale. \\r\\nDifferent to most other analogue modelling laboratories worldwide, TecLab research strongly focusses on developing novel ideas and methodologies to address deformation processes on the scale of the entire lithosphere. The fundamental as well as applied research performed in the TecLab is relevant not only for research into long and short term deformation processes, but also for geo-hazards and geo-resources (e.g. oil & gas, geothermal energy). \\r\\nIn the last 20 years many collaborative tectonic modelling studies in the TecLab have been applied successfully to a range of natural laboratories, each characterised by a unique geodynamic setting and different plate tectonic processes. Examples of such integrated, process-oriented case studies include the formation of mountain ranges (e.g. European Alps, the Caucasus, the Pyrenees), the evolution of sedimentary basin systems (e.g. the Pannonian Basin, the Aegean basins), the break-up of continents (the East African Rift) and associated formation of new oceanic basins (the Barents Sea; the South Atlantic).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TecLab infrastructure includes:\\r\\n \\r\\n1. devices for determining the physical properties of the analogue materials (rheometer, Krantz-type shear apparatus, pycnometers etc.) \\r\\n2. several, differently sized deformation boxes connected to stepping motors to run the analogue experiments \\r\\n3. equipment for monitoring and analysing the experiments. The latter includes next to standard digital photography and sectioning of the experiments, novel non-destructive CT and surface scanning techniques to calculate incremental and finite displacement and strain fields in 3D.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information please visit the TecLab website: https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/faculty-of-geosciences/collaboration/labs-and-facilities/teclab or e-mail the TecLab: [teclab.geo@uu.nl](mailto:teclab.geo@uu.nl)\"\n",

      "    \"description\": \"Analogue modelling is a well-established technique to investigate the evolution of tectonic structures in the Earth's crust and lithosphere. Scaled analogue models offer the opportunity to determine the relation between imposed boundary conditions and the resulting structures. The strength of such models lies in stimulating the conception of testable hypotheses about the development of tectonic structures in nature.\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\r\\nThe Tectonic Laboratory at the University of Bern (TecLab Bern) offers innovative and state-of-the-art facilities to model and analyse in detail a large variety of tectonic settings. Analogue models can be analysed by X-ray computed tomography (XRCT) using a 64-slice Siemens Somaton Definition AS medical scanner. XRCT is a technique which permits visualisation of the interior of a model without destroyig it, hence allowing an in-depth analysis of the 3-D geometry of model structures. Full 3D imaging of analogue models using XRCT allows the reconstruction of any desired section, be it horizontal, vertical or oblique and can provide  constraints for seismic analysis of compex tectonic zones where seismic data are often fragmentary and difficult to interpret.\\r\\n\\r\\nXRCT analysis of analogue models at regular time intervals makes it possible to understand the 3D evolution of structures in time (4D). 4D XRCT data sets obtained from analogue models provide the opportunity to re-run the experiment on the computer screen and thus represents a valuable database not only for seismic interpreters but also for teaching and outreach purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDigital volume correlation (DVC) techniques on XRCT volumetric data can be used to quantify the 3D spatial and temporal strain patterns inside analogue models  at high resolution. Such strain quantification of analogue experiments is of great importance when comparing analogue models with numerical models tudies. We have successfully applied DVC to models consisting of both brittle and viscous analogue model materials.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TecLab Bern has several deformation devices, including an innovate experimental apparatus (whose size is adapted for XRCT analysis) with computer-controlled stepper motors that permits  the combined displacement of baseplates and sidewalls allowing oblique deformational movements (oblique extension, oblique shortening).  Another device allows the simulation of extensional rotational movements about a pivoting axis, and its size also permits analysis by medical XRCT scanning.  \\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Please find further informations, photos and animations here: http://www.geo.unibe.ch/research/tectonics/laboratories/tectonic_modelling_lab/index_eng.html\"\n",

Although these\\r\\nmodels simplify the geometry and rheology, they represent a realistic\\r\\ndynamic and geometric replica of the prototype. The laboratory is\\r\\nequipped with a number of apparatuses (operating in both normal and\\r\\nenhanced gravity) that may simulate the different tangential and\\r\\nvertical forces acting in nature. Specifically, the apparatuses can\\r\\ninduce deformation in both pure and simple shear conditions, allowing to\\r\\ninvestigate a large variety of crustal and lithospheric-scale\\r\\nexperiments in extensional, compressional, or strike slip settings.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Laboratory equipment:\\r\\n\\r\\n-   1 large-capacity centrifuge PM980R (ALC International) that allows\\r\\n    the deformation of physical models in an enhanced gravitational\\r\\n    field, particularly suitable to model the continental extension\\r\\n    processes.\\r\\n\\r\\n-   1 pure-simple shear prototype apparatus that allows to vary the\\r\\n    kinematics imposed to the mobile wall, thereby simulating the\\r\\n    deformation in different tectonic settings. A special apparatus\\r\\n    consists of an electrically-controlled piston that injects the\\r\\n    silicone into the model to reproduce the emplacement of analogue\\r\\n    magma during deformation.\\r\\n\\r\\n-   1 pure shear prototype apparatus that allows the unidirectional\\r\\n    deformation of the model.\\r\\n\\r\\n-   1 coni-cylindrical viscometer for measuring the viscosity of\\r\\n    experimental ductile materials.\\r\\n\\r\\n-   1 apparatus for interferometric analysis of model surface.\\r\\n    Sequential 3D digital elevation models (DEM) allow to analyze the\\r\\n    evolution of tectonic structures and associated topographic response\\r\\n    in great detail.\\r\\n\\r\\n-   1 laser scanner Optix 400M (3D Digital Corporation) for monitoring\\r\\n    (in all deformation apparatuses) the evolution of model topography\\r\\n    through time.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Research activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe activity of the \\u2018Tectonic Modelling Laboratory\\u2019\\r\\naims to investigate geological and tectonic processes occurring in\\r\\nnature at different scales, from mesoscopic to lithospheric.
