**Group of Magnetic Applications (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona
(UAB), Spain)**

The group of magnetic applications, is part of the Geology department at
the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. It is a relatively small group of
people doing research on geomagnetism (mainly on magnetostratigraphy and
archaeomagnetism) with strong links with the larger Laboratory of
Paleomagnetism (CSIC-ICTJA and Universitat de Barcelona, Spain). The
equipment used by our members is basically that of the Laboratory of
Paleomagnetism at the University of Barcelona. However, our group has
some equipment on his own: palaeomagnetic sampling equipment, a number
of magnetic susceptibility meters and a Mössbauer spectrometer.
