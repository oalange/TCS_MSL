**Paleomagnetic and Rock Magnetic Laboratory (Universidad de Burgos,
Spain)**

The paleomagnetic and rock-magnetic laboratory of the Burgos University
was founded by the paleomagnetic research group of this institution
thanks to several European and Spanish research projects. It is located
in the polytechnic school of the Burgos University. The laboratory is
fully equipped to perform research in the fields of paleomagnetism and
rock magnetism. From the beginning it has shown an open attitude towards
collaboration with other research groups and has been visited by many
researchers from other institutions. The paleomagnetic group of the
Burgos University includes 12 researchers and technicians, 7 of which
hold a PhD.

The laboratory offers the possibility of measurements carried out by our
technical staff. In addition we provide training and supervision to
researchers who come to use the facilities of the laboratory. The
laboratory has experience in the treatment of very different types of
materials and we can also advice and help in the preparation of samples.

-   The Paleomagnetic laboratory of the University of Burgos has
    experience offering its services in different areas of application
    of paleomagnetism and rock magnetism such as:

-   Magnetostratigraphic studies focused on dating sedimentary sequences
    of different ages.

-   Archaeomagnetic studies (dating of archaeological material, magnetic
    characterization of archaeological fires, etc.)

-   Paleomagnetism applied to tectonics (plate tectonics, continental
    deformation, vertical axis rotations, sedimentary basin
    restorations, etc.).

-   Paleomagnetism applied to geomagnetism (paleointensity and secular
    variation studies)

-   Environmental magnetism with different purposes such as
    palaoenvironmental studies or characterization of pollution.

-   Study of magnetic fabrics (anisotropy of different magnetic
    properties as susceptibility, ARM, IRM, etc).
