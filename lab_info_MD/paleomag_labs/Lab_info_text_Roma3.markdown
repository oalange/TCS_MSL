The Laboratory of Paleomagnetism of Roma TRE has been established in
1996. It is provided of the main instrumentations and facilities used
for: 1) paleomagnetic analysis for the reconstruction of tectonic
processes (geodynamic evolution of the Mediterranean area, tectonic
evolution of Iran; tectonic evolution of the Anatolia Plateau); 2)
analysis of deformation using the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility;
3) volcanic paleomagnetism (Magnetic fabric analysis and implications
for pyroclastic flow and lahar emplacement; definition of emplacement
temperatures in ignimbrites; Dikes emplacement and implications on the
feeding system in volcanic apparatus).
