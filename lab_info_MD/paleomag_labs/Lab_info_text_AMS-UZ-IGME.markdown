History: The laboratory began operation at the University of Zaragoza in
1991. Since then, there has been a continuous research activity that led
to numerous PhD, MSc as well as the Research Postgraduates.
Paleomagnetism within the IGME began in 2005. In recent years several
Doctoral Theses supervised by members of this team have been presented.
Since 2016 both belong to the Associate Unit in Earth Sciences UZ/IGME

Expertise:

-   University of Zaragoza: Magnetic fabrics (AMS) and paleomagnetism in
    sedimentary rocks of the Iberian plate and North Africa, applied to
    the development of inverted basins, construction of orogens and salt
    tectonics. Magnetic fabrics in granitic rocks, dykes and volcanic
    rocks in Variscan and Alpine systems in relation to the emplacement
    model of magmas. Magnetic fabrics in fault rocks as indicator of
    deformation. Geophysical surveying and interpretation of magnetic
    and gravity anomalies. The team have also developed magnetic fabric
    studies in Crete, paleomagnetism in New Mexico (vertical axis
    rotation relative to normal faults) and in Antarctica (determination
    of palaeotopography), and magnetism of rocks in Iceland.

-   IGME Zaragoza: Paleomagnetism and magnetostratigraphy applied to
    orogenic belts and basin analysis. AMS. Environmental magnetism.
    Software development for paleomagnetic data processing and 3D
    restitution incorporating paleomagnetic data. Paleomagnetism and AMS
    databases. Geomagnetic prospection. Biomagnetism.

    MPMS-XL, PPMS 9T, 14T PPMS.

Other instruments: NanoMOKE3 (Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect) and permeameter
(PERMAC).

Furthermore, this laboratory is used for teaching purposes in the
Master's studies in Geology, and for informative purposes, to bring
Paleomagnetism closer to society.
