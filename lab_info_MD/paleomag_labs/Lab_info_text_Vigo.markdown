Paleomagnetic information is derived from a variety of materials and
environments. Rock outcrops and lava flows are among the most common
types. Marine sediments and rocks are also a useful archive of
information about past magnetic fields. Among its advantages is the
continuity of the record, frequently much better than continental
counterparts. Our Laboratory of Paleomagnetism at the University of Vigo
is affiliated with the School of Marine Sciences at the University of
Vigo, and marine research is our main, but not exclusive, focus. The
equipment is therefore suited for managing both rock and sediment
samples, either continental, lacustrine or marine in origin.

Our laboratory has three main working areas for integrated studies, with
a focus on the marine realm:

1. Paleomagnetic sample processing and measurements

2. Sedimentological processing and measurements

3. Marine acoustics and physical oceanography

In addition, we also have easy access to an adjacent laboratory hosting
a long-core cryogenic magnetometer, with capabilities to measure both
discrete and u-channel samples, and a Physical Properties Measuring
System, with capabilities to reach up to 9T.
