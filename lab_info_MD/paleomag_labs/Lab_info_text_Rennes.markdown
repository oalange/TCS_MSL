The Earth’s Magnetic Field varies on significant timescale from its
secular variation to polarity reversals and long-term changes in
polarity reversal frequency to field intensities. The studies of the
remanent magnetization of archeologic artefacts and rocks are the only
means to survey how the magnetic field is generated in the earth’s core
on long time scales (103 yr. to 109 yr.).

But the record of the earth’s magnetic field in rocks and archeologic
material can also be used for different purposes. Magnetostratigraphy
and archeomagnetic dating are important dating methods.

Paleomagnetism was obviously the main contribution to the development of
Plate Tectonics and is still an important method in tectonic studies.

Our laboratory has a long history starting in the mid-seventies with
major contributions on tectonics, geomagnetic reversals, paleosecular
variation and archeomagnetic dating. The archeomagnetic/paleomagnetic
laboratory is hosted within a multi-disciplinary geosciences facility
(UMR Géosciences Rennes – CNRS – Université de Rennes1).

Our lab facility consists of four basic components:

1.  Measurements of the remanent magnetizations: cryogenic magnetometer
    (2G helium free, hosted in a shielded room) and spinner
    magnetometers (Agico JR6A, JR5A and Molspin)

2.  Demagnetizing facilities: two MMTD furnaces for thermal
    demagnetization, a 2G AF degausser online with the cryogenic
    magnetometer, a GSD1 AF Schonstedt degausser.

3.  Imparting artificial remanent magnetizations: Homemade furnaces for
    thermoremanent magnetization acquisition in air or in vacuum
    (paleointensity studies), Isothermal Remanent Magnetization ASC
    pulse remagnetizers up to 4T; Anhysteretic Remanent Magnetization
    acquisition with the 2G AF degausser. One electromagnet up to 1T.

4.  Magnetic properties : study of the anisotropy of the magnetic
    susceptibility (KLY3S), and variation of the susceptibility with
    temperature.
