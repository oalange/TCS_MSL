**Laboratory of Paleomagnetism (Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM)
and CSIC-IGEO, Spain)**

The Palaeomagnetic and rock magnetic laboratory unit belongs to the
Central Services of the Complutense University (CAI: Physical and
Chemical Techniques). The lab facilities include a superconducting rock
magnetometer (SQUID 755SRM Magnetometer) and two thermal demagnetizers,
located within a Magnetic Shielded Room, as well as a MMVFTB Curie
Translation Balance. The research unit facilities also include several
spinner magnetometers, susceptibility and coercivity meters and pulse
magnetisers of the group of Paleomagnetism of the Department of Physics
of the Earth and Astrophysics.

In addition to common rutine paleomagnetic and rockmagnetic
measurements, we provide several models describing the evolution of the
earth magnetic field for the last 14000 years (models: SCHA. DIF.3k and
SCHA.DIF.8k, and SHA.DIF.14K) as well as an archaeomagnetic dating
software package (archeo-dating) for dating archaeological sites and
Holocene volcanic eruptions.
