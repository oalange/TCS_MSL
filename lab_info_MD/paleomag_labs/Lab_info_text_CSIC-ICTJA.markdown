**Laboratory of Paleomagnetism (CSIC-ICTJA and Universitat de Barcelona,
Spain)**

The Paleomagnetic Laboratory of Barcelona was founded in 1987. It
resulted from an agreement reached between the "Consejo Superior de
Investigaciones Científicas" (CSIC) and the Catalonian Geological
Service, which in that moment was attached to the "Departament de
Política Territorial i Obres Públiques" of the Generalitat de Catalunya.
Nowadays, the laboratory depends on the CCiTUB (University of Barcelona)
and the CSIC. It is located in the Institute of Earth Sciences "Jaume
Almera", a building property of the CSIC in the University Area.

The laboratory provides technical support to research groups working on
several research topics within the Earth Sciences, among them:

-   Magnetostratigraphic dating of sedimentary sequences and correlation
    with their fossil and paleoenvironmental record.

-   Paleomagnetism applied to the study of orogenic belts and plate
    tectonics.

-   Archaeomagnetic dating of archaeological remains.

-   Environmental magnetic studies aimed to unravel paleoenvironmental
    and climatic variations in the sedimentary record

The laboratory offers two modalities of measurements: either conducted
by the technical staff or a self-service use of facilities. During
self-service measurements technical staff trains the user on the use of
the equipment and provides supervision during the analyses.
