The CEREGE Rock Magnetism Laboratory offers a large panel of instruments
for paleomagnetic and rock magnetic experiments and measurements
dedicated to the geosciences. The Laboratory focuses on different
research topics of the CEREGE Institute: Earth magnetic field variations
and magnetism of extraterrestrial material (meteorites, lunar rock
samples). In addition the laboratory study rock magnetic records of
natural sedimentary archives in order to provide proxies of climatic,
environmental and anthropic interest. Finally the Laboratory deals with
tectonics and studies dedicated to geodynamics and rock deformation.
