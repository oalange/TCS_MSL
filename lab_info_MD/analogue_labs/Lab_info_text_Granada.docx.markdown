**Laboratorio de Modelización Analógica de Estructuras Geológicas
(Universidad de Granada, Spain)**

The Laboratory of Analogue Modelling of Geological Structures of the
Universidad de Granada is equipped with a table of experiments with two
electric motors with variable speed (between 2 and 100 mm / hour). This
allows multiple configurations of experiments in order to simulate
different geological situations as shortening, extension, lateral
sliding or combinations among them. The calibrated analogue materials
are sand, silicone, glass microspheres. The rheology of these materials
together with the imposed velocity range make that our experiment
correspond to upper-crustal levels. The experiments are recorded
photographically by programmable digital cameras over several days,
allowing the development of automated experiments. Plasticine has also
been used for educational purposes (bachelor’s degree).
