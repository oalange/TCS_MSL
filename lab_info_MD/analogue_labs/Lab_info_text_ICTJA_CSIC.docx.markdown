**Magma Chamber Analogue Modelling Laboratory (CSIC-ICTJA, Spain)**

Magma chamber analogue modelling system consists of a pressurizable (up
to 6 atm) transparent glass cylinder of 25 cm diameter and 40 cm height,
which includes a barometer and a thermocouple, to track temperature and
internal pressure tracked during the whole experiment, allows the
entrance of different fluids in the same experiment in order to
visualize the effect of mixing magmas of diverse types and properties,
also allows to inject pressurized gas into the mixture, so we can study
the effect of volatiles in the occurring processes, and also can heat
the fluids up to around 80 (degC) to be able to consider variations in
their properties (e.g. density or viscosity) due to temperature changes.
Decompression of the tank is controlled by a series of external valve
remotely operated, and two high speed digital cameras of high resolution
document the experiments allowing internal measurements of fluid
structures developing during the experiments such as fountains, drops ,
etc.
