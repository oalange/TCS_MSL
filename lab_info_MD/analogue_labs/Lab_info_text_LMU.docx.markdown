Explosive volcanic eruptions and their eruptive products impact humans,
the environment and infrastructures on local, regional and global
scales. For the wide-reaching hazard they pose to our global society,
the focus of volcanology is to determine the process controlling the
eruptive dynamics of volcanoes and their impact on the Earth system.
Modern volcanology is founded on three main methodological pillars: 1)
field observations and measurements, 2) laboratory experiments, 3)
numerical modelling. The combination of those techniques is paramount to
untangle the highly complex nature of processes controlling volcanic
eruptions and to provide a reliable and quantitative estimate of the
hazard they pose. In particular laboratory research is pivotal in the
way it provides quantitative fundamental input parameters to constrain
both field observation and numerical models. The experimental
volcanology facilities at LMU University of Munich is equipped with
world-class unique experimental setups and bench instruments which
enable characterization of materials and simulation of processes at
conditions relevant to volcanic eruptions.
