The Laboratory of Geochronology and Isotope Geochemistry of IGG-CNR
(Italy) provides an integrated system of expertise, instrumental
facilities and analytical protocols, suitable to accurately carry out:

1.  geochronologic data by means of 40Arâ€“39Ar radiometric dating of
    potassic glasses and mineral, archaeomagentic dating of volcanic
    deposits and fiery structures, fission track analysis on apatite and
    zircon:

2.  isotopic analysis of a wide variety of solid and aqueous matrices
    thanks to the availability of TIMS and MC-ICPMS techniques.

The analytical skills of the IGG-CNR of Pisa2 are related to
archaeomagnetic dating. The laboratory include an induction magnetometer
with large cell; four sampling-in-the-field sets; sample conditioning
and measurement facilities.

Methods and Expertise

Archaeomagentic dating of volcanic deposits and fiery structures. The
method produces archaeomagnetic age by directional analyses on volcanic
and archaeological materials. The technique used is the BSPM (Big Sample
Plaster Method) based on the measurement of Inclination and Declination
vectors the magnetic minerals inside samples acquired at the moment of
the passage under the Curie Temperature. Archaeomagnetic dating is a
powerful tool for the reconstruction of the chrono-stratigraphy of
recent (up to 10.000 years BP) volcanic activity, and able to produce
very good quality absolute ages of fiery object (typically furnaces) of
archaeological interest.
