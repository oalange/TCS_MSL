The Laboratory of Geochronology and Isotope Geochemistry of IGG-CNR
(Italy) provides an integrated system of expertise, instrumental
facilities and analytical protocols, suitable to accurately carry out:
1) geochronologic data by means of 40Arâ€“39Ar radiometric dating of
potassic glasses and mineral, archaeomagentic dating of volcanic
deposits and fiery structures, fission track analysis on apatite and
zircon: 2) isotopic analysis of a wide variety of solid and aqueous
matrices thanks to the availability of TIMS and MC-ICPMS techniques. The
analytical skills of the IGG-CNR of Firenze are related to Fission Track
Analysis.

The laboratory includes:

1.  Zeiss Axioskop Microscope equipped with a Kinetek stage, light
    camera, digital tablet, PC+software for fission-track analysis

2.  Stereomicroscope equipped with camera for apatite grain selection
    and single apatite grain packing for U-Th/He analysis.

Access to:

1.  mineral separation laboratory for apatite and zircon concentration
    from rock samples

2.  thin section and special preparation laboratory for sample mountings
    and preparation of mica (external detector)-sample sandwich for
    irradiation.

Methods and Expertise:

Fission Track Analysis on apatite and zircon. Apatite grain selection
for (U-Th-Sm)/He. Use of forward and inverse thermal modelling (HeFTy,
QTQt, Pecube). The method can be applied to a wide range of rocks and
dynamic environments for the reconstruction of rock thermal history in
the more surficial levels of the crust, to landscape evolution and
source to sink studies.
