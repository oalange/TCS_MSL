**Electron Microprobe (LNEG-UCTM, Portugal)**

UCTM Laboratory of LNEG is a Mineral Technology Laboratory and focusses
on the properties of geological materials having in mind to promote
their adequate integration in the respective industrial value chain.

The three main vectors of activity are:

1. Bulk chemical characterization of geological materials –
quantification of rocks’ major and minor elements, using different
techniques and quantification limits;

2. Mineralogy of geological materials – identification of the relevant
mineral phases that host the valuable chemical elements and of the
correlated physical properties and modelling (experimental, “ab-initio”,
“multiscale molecular dynamics”, etc.) of the behavior of those
materials when incorporated in artifacts;

3. Technological characterization and mineral processing –
characterization and upgrading of the minerals natural properties,
industrial rocks and ores before entering in the more advanced steps of
the industrial value chain.

These vectors are applied to several types of geological materials:

− Metallic ores

− Industrial minerals

− Dimension and ornamental stones

− Natural mineral waters

Giving support to projects of:

− Exploration of mineral deposits

− Technical characterization of industrial minerals and rocks, including
the dimension stones

− Textural and quantitative mineralogy

− Mineral Processing for the valorization of mineral raw materials

Using different techniques and methods:

− Chemical analysis (classic methods; AA, XRF, Plasma, IC)

− Optical Microscopy, EPMA and XRD

− Technical testwork

− Mineral Processing batch and experimental intensification tests
(piloting)
