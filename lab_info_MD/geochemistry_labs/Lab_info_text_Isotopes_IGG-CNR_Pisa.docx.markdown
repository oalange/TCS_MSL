The Laboratory of Geochemistry and Stable Isotope of the Institute of
Geosciences and Earth Resources (IGG) is a multicomponent lab where a
wide spectrum of geochemical and isotope analyses could be performed.
Our researches are focalized on the composition and the origin of
terrestrial gases and fluids (magmatic, hydrothermal, geothermal ones),
from which precipitate minerals, interact with the geo-bio sphere, feed
aquifers, circulate in the Earthâ€™s surface. Our aim is to Identify the
history of an igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic rock, identify the role
of fluids in the formation or alteration of rocks as well as to
reconstruct climatic variation during the past. We characterize the
physical-chemical processes active at depth and its evolution during the
ascent of fluids as well as thermal and pressure conditions at depth. We
identify the water origin and its quality and we study of the fate of
contaminants.

The lab could be performed a large spectrum of analyses. In particular:

Measurement of both the content of total hydrogen, nitrogen, organic and
inorganic carbon (H, TN, TOC, TIC) in solid, liquid and gas samples,
their isotopic bulk composition, carbon and oxygen isotopic composition
of CO<sub>2</sub>, carbon compound specific stable isotope analysis
(CSIA) of gas samples;

-   Determination, by wet analysis, of the main, minor and trace
    chemical components in natural waters, geothermal brines, thermal
    waters and landfill effluents;

-   Determinations of gas components (CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S,
    HCl, HF, NH<sub>3</sub> etc.) enriched in alkaline solution or
    present as dry gases in natural gases and/or geothermal/volcanic
    vapors. Diffuse flux measurements (in particular CO<sub>2</sub> and
    CH<sub>4</sub>);

-   Noble gas determinations (He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe) in gas samples and
    also in fumarole discharge.
