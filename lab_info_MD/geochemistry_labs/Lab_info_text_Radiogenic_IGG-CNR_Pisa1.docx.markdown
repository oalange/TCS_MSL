The Laboratory of Geochronology and Isotope Geochemistry of IGG-CNR
(Italy) provides an integrated system of expertise, instrumental
facilities and analytical protocols, suitable to accurately carry out:

1.  geochronologic data by means of

    1.  40Ar–39Ar radiometric dating of potassic glasses and mineral,

    2.  archaeomagentic dating of volcanic deposits and fiery
        structures,

    3.  fission track analysis on apatite and zircon:

2.  isotopic analysis of a wide variety of solid and aqueous matrices
    thanks to the availability of TIMS and MC-ICPMS techniques.

The analytical skills of the IGG-CNR of Pisa1 laboratory include:

Methods and Expertise

Geochronology

40Ar–39Ar Geochronology of potassic glasses and minerals. The method can
be applied to a wide range of geological problems and to rocks varying
in age from a few thousand years to the oldest rocks available.

Current extractions methods include:

1.  in-situ dating of rock chips and of single mineral grains at high
    spatial resolution;

2.  step-heating analyses of single crystal or population of mineral
    grains;

3.  total fusion analyses of single crystal or population of grains.

Expertise: geochronology of volcanic rocks, with special reference to
Quaternary volcanic products (including tephra); geochronology of
brittle (pseudotachylytes) and ductile deformations.

Isotope Geochemistry (Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry – TIMS;
MC-ICP-MS)

Analysis of Sr, Nd, and Pb radiogenic isotopes and Fe, Li, B stable
isotopes on a wide variety of solid and aqueous matrices, such as
silicate rocks and minerals, limestones, thermal waters, brines.

Expertise includes:

1.  characterization of magma mantle sources, magma evolutionary
    processes, relationships between geodynamics and magmatic activity;

2.  magmatic-hydrothermal transition and implications for active and
    fossil hydrothermal systems;

3.  subduction-related mass transfer, processes occurring at slab
    interface and deep recycling of subducted material.
