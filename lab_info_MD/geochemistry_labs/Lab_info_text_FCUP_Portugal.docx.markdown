**LCGM Laboratory for Characterization of Geological Materials (FCUP,
Portugal)**

*Fluid Inclusions Laboratory:*

Fluid inclusions analysis

• Description of different fluid inclusion populations.

Microthermometry (Th, Tm)

• Salinity and minimal temperature of entrapment.

Raman microspectrometry/spectroscopy

• Concentration of gases (CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>,
N<sub>2</sub>).

• Identification of mineral phases.

The laboratory is equipped with a Chaixmeca and Linkam stages, cooled
and heated (-180°C to 600°C) by automated temperature regulation and by
a Horiba Jobin-Yvon LabRAM spectrometer (632.8 nm, He-Ne laser) coupled
to an Olympus microscope.

*Raman Laboratory: *

Raman spectroscopy analysis

• Identification and characterization of mineral phases.

Raman spectrometry analysis

• Concentration of gases in fluid inclusions (CH<sub>4</sub>,
CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>).

The laboratory is equipped with a LabRAM and XploRATM microspectrometers
(Horiba Jobin Yvon) for localized analysis, sample mapping and combined
Raman spectroscopy/microthermometry analysis. The available excitation
wavelengths are 532 nm, 632.8 nm, and 785 nm.
