**Geomechanics Laboratory, GEOLAB-CERENA (Instituto Superior Técnico,
Portugal)**

The Geomechanics Laboratory of CERENA/Instituto Superior Técnico
(GEOLAB-CERENA/TECNICO) develops investigation in the field of Rock and
Soil Mechanics applied to Mining, Petroleum and Geotechnical
Engineering.

The GEOLAB-CERENA/TECNICO is a member of the European Plate Observing
System EPOS and is broadly supplied with experimental equipment for the
analysis of rock physics and geomechanics with the measurement of rock
properties like strength, elasticity, porosity, etc., and the modeling
of subsurface sites and geological environments through a suite of
customizable deformation devices.

GEOLAB-CERENA/TECNICO has equipment that provides the execution of
standard laboratorial and in situ tests and quantifying deformation in
analogue models and high-resolution digital modeling through acoustic
emissions, piezo and MEM accelerometers and meets the requests of mining
and geotechnical companies developing frequently experimental surveys
and technical reports. The development of innovative tests in this
laboratory is also strongly encouraged for PhD and Master Students.
