The HPT or High Pressure and Temperature Laboratory at Utrecht University is one of the largest and best-known university laboratories for rock and fault mechanics research at elevated pressures and temperatures in Europe.  It is run by the _Experimental Rock Deformation Group_ (https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences/experimental-rock-deformation), within the Department of Earth Sciences, led by Prof. C.J. Spiers and colleagues Prof.  J.H.P. de Bresser, Dr. C.J. Peach, Dr. A.R. Niemeijer and Dr. S.J.T. Hangx. From around January 2019, the HPT Lab will be located at a new site on the UU campus, within the newly built Earth Simulation Laboratory (ESL) complex.

The Experimental Rock Deformation Group, also known simply as the HPT Lab, specializes in research on the mechanical behaviour and transport properties of Earth materials at conditions ranging from the upper crust to upper mantle, with a focus on the effects of fluid-rock interaction. The HPT laboratory is equipped with a wide variety of facilities for addressing these topics and is supported by a team of three dedicated technicians. 

Equipment available ranges from apparatus for deformation and fault friction/rheology studies at pressures and temperatures up to 600 MPa and 1200 °C, to equipment for permeametry and impedance measurement, as well as high temperature furnaces and apparatus for thermal, microstructural and IR analysis. 
Transnational access to the HPT lab facilities is available in the framework of _EPOS TCS Multi-scale laboratories_ (https://www.epos-ip.org/tcs/multi-scale-laboratories/data-services/transnational-access-tna).
