**Experimental Geoscience Facility (The University of Edinburgh, UK)**

The Experimental Geoscience facility at the University of Edinburgh is a
nationally recognized facility dedicated to experimental investigations
of physical and chemical processes in a wide range of geological media.
Capability extends from low temperature and pressure investigations in
aqueous media to studies of the immediate subsurface (including anoxic ±
sulfidic environments) through reservoir and upper crust conditions to
lower crust and upper mantle conditions associated with metamorphic and
igneous processes. The facility is experienced in experimental equipment
development, design and construction.

The facility comprises several components:

1.  Experimental Aqueous Geochemistry Laboratory for sub 100°C studies
    of aqueous processes, including mineral formation, geochemical
    kinetics, stable isotope experiments, anoxic sulfidic experiments
    and electrochemical studies.

2.  Experimental Microtomography Laboratory. The µCT instrument was
    designed and built in-house and is dedicated to experimental
    investigations of processes in geological media. In addition it can
    provide non-destructive materials characterization services. Sample
    size from 1 mm to 100 mm, resolution from 1 µm to 100 µm.

3.  Experimental Microtomography Experimental Environments. A suite of
    cells designed and built in-house for both laboratory and
    synchrotron x-ray microtomography. Includes capacity for studies of
    multiphase flow at elevated pressure (to 20 MPa), fluid rock
    reaction (200°C, 20 MPa), Small sample (3mm) triaxial deformation
    (150°C and 30 MPa) and ambient temperature triaxial deformation
    coupled with acoustic monitoring and velocity measurement.

4.  Data and image analysis suite for x-ray microtomography

5.  Experimental Rock Physics. Rock deformation at up to 70 MPa using
    38mm diameter samples, coupled to axial acoustic emission and
    velocity measurements and permeability analysis.

6.  Atmospheric furnace laboratory. Sample preparation and experiments
    in muffle furnaces (to 1750°) and controlled fO2 furnaces (to
    1600°C) at ambient pressure.

7.  Externally heated and internally heated gas pressure vessel
    laboratories. Experimentation is welded metal capsules at up to 200
    MPa and 600°C (cold seal vessels) and up to 1200°C and 800 MPa
    (IHGPVs).

8.  Solid Media Laboratory. Two end-loaded piston cylinder rigs for
    experimental mineral physics and chemistry studies up to 4 GPa and
    1600°C. Can use ½” or ¾” ceramic assemblies, and bespoke assembly
    design is possible.
