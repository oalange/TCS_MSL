The research topics we address result from sustainable use of geothermal
energy, carbon dioxide sequestration, and the use of natural methane
hydrate deposits. In addition to characterizing a rockâ€™s actual state
investigations on dynamic processes and time-dependent physical changes
are conducted. All experiments are performed under controlled pressure
and temperature conditions that represent possible in situ conditions
during reservoir use. Our experimental methodology is continuously
developed further to conduct experiments at progressively more extreme,
e.g. supercritical, conditions. Linking reservoir exploration and
exploitation of geological reservoirs our scientific results contribute
to their sustainable use. Our laboratories comprise state-of-the-art
experimental devices for high pressure and high temperature rock
mechanical, rock physical, and fluid physical investigations.
