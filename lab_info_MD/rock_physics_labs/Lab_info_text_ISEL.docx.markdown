**Microseismology and Rock Physics Laboratory (ISEL - Physics
Department, Portugal)**

Measurement of physical and mechanical properties of rocks and other
natural or man-made materials (uniaxial compressive strength, strength
under triaxial conditions – Hoek cell), elastic modulus, deformation
modulus, Poisson’s ratio, strain field, stress field.

Monitoring of acoustic emission (8 channels) and dynamic properties of
rocks under uniaxial deformation., p- and s-wave velocities, etc.
