Deep earth processes are either inferred form geophysical observations
or from direct observation of formerly deep-seated rocks that are now
accessible at the surface. The interpretation of the processes that have
formed these rocks and are acting at great depth today is only possible
through experimental studies that simulate high pressure and high
temperature conditions. Magma formation, mineral reactions, phase
transformations, and deformation and their mutual interaction are the
main processes studied in the rock physics laboratories at the
Department of Geosciences at the University of Troms√∏.

There are two laboratories:

1.  Rock Deformation Laboratory

2.  Hydrostatic Piston Cylinder Laboratory. Both laboratories employ
    solid medium high pressure and temperature technology
