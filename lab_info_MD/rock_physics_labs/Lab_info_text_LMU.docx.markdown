Simulating geodynamic processes is a challenging task because of the
non-linearity and scale dependence of most associated processes. A great
challenge is the multispectral character of lithosphere deformation
ranging from earthquake rupture (seconds) to fault zone evolution
(Millions of years). Recent advances in experimental techniques like
high resolution monitoring and complex analogue rheologies made it
possible to develop models simulating deformation on all relevant
timescales with high spatial resolution. We follow an integrated
modelling approach involving structural-kinematic modelling, analogue
experiments and numerical simulations. We are a member of the European
Plate Observing System EPOS, the European Training Networks TOPOMOD and
SUBITOP, the Helmholtz Graduate School GEOSIM and the DFG-Collaborative
Research Center SFB1114 “Scaling Cascades in Complex Systems”. In the
year 2014 we hosted the GEOMOD conference at GFZ Potsdam and edited the
corresponding Tectonophysics special issue.

Please find an introductory text to our lab here. Our lab facility
consists of four basic components:

1.  The Analogue rock physics lab featuring all kind of experimental
    devices for measuring rock analogue materials’ properties including
    friction, elasticity, viscosity etc.

2.  The Analogue modelling lab featuring a suite of customizable
    deformation devices for simulating (seismo)tectonic and other
    geological processes

3.  The Experimental monitoring lab providing the means of quantifying
    deformation in analogue models and experiments using cutting-edge
    high-resolution digital image correlation methods, force and
    pressure sensors, piezo and MEMS accelerometers etc.

4.  The Numerical simulation and analysis lab allowing to cross-validate
    and analyse in great detail the models and experiments using
    state-of-the-art numerical simulation and data analysis tools
