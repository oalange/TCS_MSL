The High Pressure Laboratory, located at Geoscience Montpellier, is
dedicated to the experimental quantification of the physical properties
of rocks and minerals of the mantle and the crust, such as thermal
conductivity, electrical conductivity, acoustic velocities, permeability
and porosity of the rocks or other natural materials (i.e., altered
Icelandic basalts or some exotic Australian corals), ductile rheology
and semi brittle friction processes or ionic diffusion in static or
dynamic conditions. The most recent technological developments is an
inhouse build fluid injection system with pore pressure controlled for
experiments run at high pressure and high temperature using a press
Paterson (gas vessel).
