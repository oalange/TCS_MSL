**Laboratoire de déformation (CNRS-EOST/Université of Strasbourg,
France)**

The Laboratoire de Déformation des Roches (LDR) is located at the École
et Observatoire des Sciences de la Terre (EOST), Université de
Strasbourg. The LDR, part of the Géophysique Expérimentale team, houses
a variety of purpose-built equipment designed to investigate the
deformation behaviour and fluid flow properties of the Earth's crust.

Our main research focus is the hydraulic and mechanical properties of
geomaterials. In particular, we are interested in the influence of
deformation (mechanically or thermally induced damage,
pressure-solution, etc.) and failure mode (brittle or ductile) on the
evolution of rock physical properties (porosity, permeability,
electrical conductivity, etc.). We use a range of experimental, field,
and modelling techniques to study both natural geophysical phenomena
(reservoirs, faults, volcanoes, etc.) and industrial applications
(oil/gas recovery, geothermal, etc.).
