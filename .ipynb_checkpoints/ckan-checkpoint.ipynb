An important expertise of the research group is building high resolution and accurate time scales, using magnetostratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy (and astrochronology), based on correlation to astronomical solutions of past changes in the Earth’s orbit and rotation. Another major topic is the acquisition of reliable and detailed records of the geomagnetic field at all time scales, which serves to understand the past magnetic field of our planet Earth. This work includes paleointentsity and paleosecular variation studies – from recent periods (archaeomagnetism),  during periods when the field did not reverse (superchrons) -  to properties of the earliest field more than 3 billions of years ago. This field includes understanding how the ancient field was acquired in the remanent magnetization in different types of rocks (rock magnetism). Yet another key interest concerns geodynamic/tectonic studies, at different spatial and temporal scales and on several continents, but with an emphasis on the Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt. This includes the Mediterranean, Paratethys and Himalayan areas as one of the most active tectonic regions in the world.\n",

We investigate the magnetic properties of sediments at orbital to centennial timescales in various ocean basins (in combination with other tracers such as particle grain sizes and concentrations of major and trace elements), in order to characterize past changes in deep ocean circulation and in continental inputs (related to land precipitation, erosion, glaciers advances and retreats).

We also use past rapid variations in the Earth magnetic field intensity to improve the chronostratigraphy of climate archives, which is a major challenge to quantify the phasing between far-sided climatic variables and thus disentangle climate mechanisms at the global scale.

      "The tectonic modelling laboratory (TecLab) is the main research facility of the _Tectonics research group_ (https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences/tectonics), and a key infrastructure in the Earth Simulation Laboratory (ESL) of the _Department of Earth Sciences at Utrecht University (UU)_ (https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences). Research conducted in the TecLab aims to improve our fundamental understanding of the multi-scale (spatial and temporal) parameters and rock behaviour that control the mutual interaction of deep Earth and surface processes. To pursue this key objective, research performed in the TecLab is typically integrated with and strongly tied to field and numerical modelling studies, enabling to develop novel approaches and methodologies.\n",
      "This unique integrated modelling approach has established the TecLab as a renowned tectonic modelling laboratory, also evidenced by the long term involvement of the TecLab in a wide range of national and international research projects and programs (e.g. ESF TOPO-EUROPE; EU-Topomod; EU-Subitop; EU-GEMEX). Moreover, the TecLab is linked also to the Dutch Research Centre for Integrated Solid Earth Sciences, as well as to the European Plate Observatory System (EPOS). And at UU the TecLab facility plays a key role in undergraduate and graduate education as well as in outreach activities. \n",
      "In the TecLab, we use \"scaled physical analogue models\" to better understand (large scale) deformation processes that occur in the Earth’s lithosphere in response to plate motions or intra-plate deformation; examples include the breakup of the Earth's crust and the formation of sedimentary basins, the formation of mountain ranges or the development of subduction zones. The spatial scale of applications typically stretches from reservoir and basin (hundreds of meters to kilometre) to plate (hundreds of kilometres) scale. \n",
      "Different to most other analogue modelling laboratories worldwide, TecLab research strongly focusses on developing novel ideas and methodologies to address deformation processes on the scale of the entire lithosphere. The fundamental as well as applied research performed in the TecLab is relevant not only for research into long and short term deformation processes, but also for geo-hazards and geo-resources (e.g. oil & gas, geothermal energy). \n",
      "In the last 20 years many collaborative tectonic modelling studies in the TecLab have been applied successfully to a range of natural laboratories, each characterised by a unique geodynamic setting and different plate tectonic processes. Examples of such integrated, process-oriented case studies include the formation of mountain ranges (e.g. European Alps, the Caucasus, the Pyrenees), the evolution of sedimentary basin systems (e.g. the Pannonian Basin, the Aegean basins), the break-up of continents (the East African Rift) and associated formation of new oceanic basins (the Barents Sea; the South Atlantic).\n",

XRCT is a technique which permits visualisation of the interior of a model without destroyig it, hence allowing an in-depth analysis of the 3-D geometry of model structures. Full 3D imaging of analogue models using XRCT allows the reconstruction of any desired section, be it horizontal, vertical or oblique and can provide  constraints for seismic analysis of compex tectonic zones where seismic data are often fragmentary and difficult to interpret.\n",
