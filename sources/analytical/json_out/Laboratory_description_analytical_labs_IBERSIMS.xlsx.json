        "general_description": "The IBERSIMS Laboratory (CIC-UGR) hosts a Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe (SHRIMP), a Scanning Electron Microscope and a facility for sample preparation. The laboratory is mainly devoted to zircon U-Pb geochronology and oxygen isotope analysis. We also have implemented multicollector Pb isotope analyses in feldspars. Currently we are implementing Mg isotope analyses in siIicates.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            The IBERSIMS laboratory is open to all researchers. The procedure is as follows: Once contacted the IBERSIMS staff (ibersims@ugr.es), the researchers send their zircon concentrates. These are checked by us to ensure they contain enough zircon grains for the intended purposes; if not, they are returned to the user. If the concentrate is OK, we prepare a megamount, suitable for both, U-Pb and Oxygen isotope analyses. The megamount is then documented using optical microscopy (reflected and transmitted light) and SEM cathodoluminescence imaging. The images documenting each sample are then sent to the user for her/him to select the spots to be analysed. Once the marked images are returned to the lab, the mount is analysed by the lab staff following the user instructions. No physical presence of the user is required.\n\nOnce the mount is analysed, the staff reduce the data and calculate all ages and isotope ratios, sending to the user a table with all results as well as the pictures of each analysed spot made by the SHRIMP during the analyses. The data provided so can be used directly on ISOPLOT or similar software.\n\nThe laboratory staff do not work on a collaborative basis, neither make any geological interpretation of the data. This is the sole responsibility of the users.
