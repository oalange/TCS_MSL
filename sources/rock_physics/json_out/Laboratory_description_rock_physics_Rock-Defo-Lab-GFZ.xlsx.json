        "general_description": "\n\nThe central research topic of our group is towards understanding the physical and physicochemical processes that control dynamics and mechanical properties in the Earth's crust and mantle lithosphere. This covers the entire spectrum of topics ranging from geomechanics and rock physics to the rheology of crust and uppermost mantle, ranging over the entire spatial bandwidth from the laboratory through mine and reservoir scale to the deformation of tectonic plate boundaries. The goal is a quantitative scale-invariant understanding of the mechanics of deformation and mass transport processes in the lithosphere (extremely brittle to fully ductile) and includes the analysis of their spatio-temporal changes and scale dependence from the atomic structure to the regional field scale (reservoir, plate margin). In our laboratories we conduct experiments on deformation and transport processes in reservoir and crustal rocks, for example on granites or porous storage rocks such as sandstone. In experiments in which we heat and pressurize rocks, we investigate seismic and aseismic deformation processes under controlled conditions and with optimal monitoring.  We have at our disposal a laboratory equipped with many sensitive equipment for rock physics experiments. We can put rock samples under high load in different, hydraulically or gas-operated presses. With other devices, we examine the pore space, that is, the voids between the rock particles. We produce brittle fractures in rock samples. This is the same process that is responsible for earthquakes in nature.",
