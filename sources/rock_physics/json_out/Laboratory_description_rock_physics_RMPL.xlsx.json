        "general_description": "BGS's rock deformation laboratories provide an integral and essential part of the BGS science strategy, particularly within the energy, minerals and waste, land use planning and development, climate change and groundwater science areas. The laboratories are managed through several facilities including: physical properties, fluid processes research and microscopy. \nBGS is a member of the European Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Laboratory Infrastructure now operating as a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ECCSEL-ERIC), and of the European Plate Observing System (EPOS-ERIC). BGS is also one of the UK’s largest providers of postgraduate research training in the applied geosciences, with three main programs:  the Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) studentships, the Collaborative Awards in Science and Engineering CASE studentships and the BGS University Funding Initiative (BUFI).\nThe Rock Mechanics and Physics Laboratory (RMPL) undertakes research on the physical properties and behaviour of rock specifically for: planning, design and construction within the civil engineering sector; extraction and storage within the energy sector; developing our understanding of near–surface to shallow crustal earth processes in order to help predict and mitigate the effects of small and large scale geohazards.\nRMPL is equipped with a range of apparatus to study rock mechanical and physical properties from the field to the coupled processes. It is home of BGS’s large scale rock deformation apparatus, a versatile MTS Rock Testing System 815 with 4.6 MN capacity, computer-controlled, servo-controlled, hydraulic load frame capable of three configurations:\n• uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and deformability on 38 – 100 mm diameter, cylindrical specimens (76 – 250 mm in length)\n• indirect (Brazilian) tensile testing configurations on 50 – 100 mm diameter, disc specimens\n• triaxial compressive strength and deformability on 50 - 54 mm diameter, cylindrical specimens (100 – 135 mm in length)\n\nTesting undertaken in RMPL includes:\n• index (density, effective porosity, and water content)\n• uniaxial compressive strength and deformability (static elastic moduli)\n• single- and multi-stage triaxial compressive strength and deformability (static elastic moduli, Hoek-Brown and Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope calculation)\n• cyclic testing (in uniaxial and triaxial conditions)\n• indirect tensile strength of weak rocks (Brazilian Disc, FRACKiT)\n• transient permeability in triaxial compression (moderate to high permeability specimens)\n• P- and S-wave velocity in triaxial compression (including dynamic elastic moduli)\n• Acoustic emissions\n• direct shear strength (using sliding holders in triaxial compression)\n• point load strength index\n• Schmidt rebound hardness value                                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                                                                                    Please find further informations here: https://www.bgs.ac.uk/sciencefacilities/laboratories/engineering/mechanics.html\n\n\n",
