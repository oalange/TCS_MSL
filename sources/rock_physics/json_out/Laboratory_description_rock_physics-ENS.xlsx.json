        "general_description": "The Geology Laboratory of ENS is both a place for research and a place of training in Earth Sciences through teaching and research. Although the size of the laboratory is modest, it covers a very wide spectrum of research topics: geophysics, seismology, geodesy, seismotectonics, geology, rock mechanics, thermochemistry, mineralogy, geomaterials, geochemistry. This strongly favors exchanges between topics which is a strong feature of the laboratory. The scientific and educational approaches are characterized by the will to strongly couple observations/measures, experiments and modeling in order to understand the mechanisms at work, to model them and possibly to predict long term evolutions. Scale changes, spatial as well as temporal, are characteristics of our approach: from the seismic rupture to the slow mountain building processes ( team « Dynamics of the Earth ») or, concerning the transformation of materials under temperature, pressure and stress, from the cristal scale to the lithospheric plate scale (team« Geomaterials »). All these studies are based on earth/sea experiments and measurements, satellite observations and field studies in various key places of the Earth. Another characteristic of the laboratory is its rich experimental infrastructure: materials characterisation techniques, high pressure/ high temperatures equipments as well as experimental deformation equipment under controlled conditions.\n                                                                                                                                                                                          ",
